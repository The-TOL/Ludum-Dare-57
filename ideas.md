# Prepared ideas for the possible themes:

### Plant the seed:

### Decay:

### Depths:

### Recharge:

### Doors:
You wake up in a mysterious room that contains a gym.. and a door. The door is reaaaally heavy though, so you have to hit the gym.
The gym consists of WarioWare type minigames, and all the exercises are just things like "5 sets of pulling a doorknob" or "pulling the door open till failure"
Once you're strong enough to open the door, you get another, heavier door (and gym). The cycle repeats from there.

### Send signals:

### Keep it togheter:
You play as a blob who has the ability to split himself into smaller pieces of himself which he can control.
These parts are used as platforms, projectiles and lives. The more damage you take, the less pieces you have to work with.
Smaller pieces can only survive for a few seconds, so keep it togheter (wink wink nudge nudge)

### Layers:
