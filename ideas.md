# Prepared ideas for the possible themes:

### Plant the seed:

### Decay:

### Depths:
You play as a miner exploring an abandoned cave. The deeper you go, the less oxygen there is, causing you to hallucinate.
Use tools to open blocked mining paths, and rely on a poorly drawn map to track your location as darkness creeps in.
Because of the low oxygen, torches flicker and burn out faster, making lights unreliable </3

### Recharge:

### Doors:
You wake up in a mysterious room that contains a gym.. and a door. The door is reaaaally heavy though, so you have to hit the gym.
The gym consists of WarioWare type minigames, and all the exercises are just things like "5 sets of pulling a doorknob" or "pulling the door open till failure"
Once you're strong enough to open the door, you get another, heavier door (and gym). The cycle repeats from there.

### Send signals:

### Keep it together:
You play as a blob who has the ability to split himself into smaller pieces of himself which he can control.
These parts are used as platforms, projectiles and lives. The more damage you take, the less pieces you have to work with.
Smaller pieces can only survive for a few seconds, so keep it together (wink wink nudge nudge)

### Wild magic:
You're a wizard, everything you touch explodes. Think of midas touch but.. more intense.
It's a rouglike were you navigate a procedurally generated maze full of obstacles (This is dangerous cause you're always having your arms out straight forward like a zombie for some reason) and the second you touch ANYTHING, you explode. 

### Side effects:

### Bottomless:
Something inspired by [The Stanley Parable hole ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF-a52LowrI), I'll get back to this when I know what.

### Layers:
